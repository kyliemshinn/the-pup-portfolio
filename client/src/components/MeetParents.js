              Meet Mom & Dad. These are my humans, Kylie and Colten. They
              adopted me when I was 2 months old. They are both from Folsom,
              California, but we all moved to San Francisco a couple years ago.
              My mom says she's my momager, but I am not sure what that means.
              Me and dad spend a lot of the time play fighting and me and mom
              cuddle the rest of the time. They love to debate who I love more
              but they will never know... We love to go on lots of weekend trips
              as a family and they spend way too much time with me (sometimes a
              kid just needs some space!) Welcome to our website!
